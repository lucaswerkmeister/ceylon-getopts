Snopts
======

**Snopts** is a command line option parsing library for Ceylon.

The name
--------

“Snopts” is a portmanteau of “Snoo”, the [name of the Reddit alien][snoo],
and “opts”, a shorthand for “options” also known from POSIX [`getopts`][getopts].
It is named after Snoo because it was originally conceived as a [submission][origin] to [/r/DailyProgrammer][dp]
and then expanded from there.

Those of a naturally forgiving disposition might also find it within themselves to accept the backronym
“<strong>s</strong>mall G<strong>N</strong>U-style <strong>opt</strong>ion<strong>s</strong>”
(even though the G in “GNU” isn’t actually silent).
